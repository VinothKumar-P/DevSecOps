# What is DevSecOps 
DevSecOps fosuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing diffeent methods, techniess and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / secuirty experience. 

DevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor.

# Tooling

## Pre-commit time tools

In this section you can find lifecycle helpers, precommit hook tools and threat modeling tools. Threat modeling tools are specific category by themselves allowing you simulate and dicover potential gaps before you start to develop the software or during the process.

Modern DevSecOps tools allow to use Threat modeling as code or generation of threat models based on the existing code annotations.
